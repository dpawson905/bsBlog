# TODO

## Done
1. Work on forgot passowrd controller and route 
2. Give the user the ability to make their account private that way they can't be found... 
3. Move Edit Archive and Delete buttons into the blog card and finish routes
4. Work on pagination for /blogs

## Needs Work
5. Implement comments, maybe use Discuss ... this will force a user to have a discuss account but it will save me some time...
6. Refactor routes and controller... 
    - Blogs controller just needs to handle all blogs
    - Blog controller will handle all things relating to a single blog
7. Work on styles
    - Profile page needs the blog titles to be capitolized on Each Word ... CSS can do this
    - General styling and layout adjustments as needed



## SCRAPPED FOR NOW
2. Figure out how to add followers and how to follow people... maybe use a search feature to look for a user based on username?
3. Work on likes, let's use ajax for this one...
4. Give the user the ability to unfollow or remove a follower
